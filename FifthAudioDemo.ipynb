      "Assistant: मैंने एक स्थिति देखी थी जब मैं उस लिफ्ट में था जिसमें एक सीनियर ईवीपी थे जिन्हें मैं सम्मान करता हूं, जो फोर्च्यून 500 कंपनी में काम करता हूं। मुझे लगता है कि मैं इस तेज बातचीत के दौरान अच्छी तरह से पेश आया। मेरा सवाल यह है, कि एक कल्पनात्मक स्थिति में, अगर आप एक सीनियर कार्यकारी के साथ लिफ्ट में हों और आप उनके साथ एक-से-एक हों, तो आप उनके सामने कैसे पेश आते हैं? आपका पिच क्या है? हां, यह एक बड़ा सवाल है। तो मैं याद करता हूं जब मैं सालों पहले Goldman Sachs में काम करता था, मुझे लिफ्ट में होते हुए और वहाँ किसी सीनियर कार्यकारी वहाँ थे तो मुझे तनाव महसूस होता था। मैं याद करता हूं कि एक दिन वहाँ एक आदमी था जिसका नाम था बॉब स्टील, जो उस समय कंपनी के एक्झीक्यूटिव वाइस चेयरमैन थे। और मैं उसके साथ लिफ्ट में था और वहाँ कोई और भी था, और मुझे नहीं पता था कि क्या कहूँ। और तो मैंने कहा, खूबसूरत दिन है, ना? और उसने मुझे देखा जैसे कि... और जब आप खुद को नहीं बनते हैं, तो वे आपका सम्मान खो देते हैं। ठीक है, तो बस खुद को बनाए रखें। आप सिर्फ यह कह सकते हैं, हे, क्या हाल है? क्या आपने कल का गेम देखा? चाहे जैसा भी हो। मैंने जैसे नीचे जैसे उछला था वैसे अधिक नहीं होना चाहिए। ठीक है, क्योंकि मैं याद करता हूं कि लिफ्ट राइड के बाद वन न्यू यॉर्क प्लाज़ा से 49वें मंजिल से पहले मंजिल तक, जो जैसा कि लगता था लम्बा समय तक। लिफ्ट राइड के बाद, मैंने खुद से पूछा, क्या मैं बुद्धिमान लगा? क्या मैंने कुछ कहा? क्या वह मेरे करियर में मदद की? यह बेवकूफ था। बेवकूफ। और मुझे लगता है कि शायद उन्होंने मेरे लिए भी थोड़ा सम्मान खो दिया। तो आपको सिर्फ खुद को होना है। और और आपके चारों ओर के अन्य लोग, जैसे कि आपके सहयोगियों, अगर वे देखते हैं कि आप अपने आप नहीं हैं, तो वे भी आपका सम्मान खो देंगे। तो बस यह प्रेत करें कि यह व्यक्ति आपकी चाची या मामा है जिससे आपने कुछ समय से मिला नहीं। बस अपने आप रहें। बस आराम से रहें। क्योंकि डॉ. सुसे ने कहा, जो मायने देते हैं, वे ध्यान नहीं देते और जो ध्यान देते हैं, उन्हें मायने नहीं होते। आप हो जो आप हो। और जब आप साक्षात्कार में जाते हैं, और मैं याद करता हूं कि मैंने यह दौर भी देखा जब मैं कुछ समय तक नौकरी नहीं पा सका। और मैं साक्षात्कार के लिए मनोरञ्जन किया गया था। और मैं खुद को नहीं पाया। यह थोड़ा रोबोटिक था, ना, जैसे मार्क\n"
